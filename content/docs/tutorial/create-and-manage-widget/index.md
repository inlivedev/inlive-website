# How to Create & Manage your Widget
### Introduction
In this tutorial, we will walk you through on how to create and manage your widget from registering it through the InLive Studio site, Updating information about the widget, deleting the widget and lastly generating the widget key for you to be able to use our API.

## Prerequisites
-   A basic understanding of using the web browser
-   A Google Account to login into the InLive Studio Site
## Logging in to the InLive Studio Site

The first step is to navigate to the InLive Studio Site, you can access it by clicking the following URL studio.inlive.app. Once you open the URL you will be greeted with a login request. Currently the site only supports login with a Google Account.

The login page should be similar to the screen capture below :

## Navigating to the Widget List

The next step is to navigate to the Widgets Menu. First you open the settings menu that is located on the left side. On the settings page, you should see the "Widget" tab to view all of your widgets or you can go by clicking the following [URL](https://dev-studio.inlive.app/settings/widget/). Since it’s your first time you will be asked to create a new widget.

## Creating Widget

To create a widget, simply press the “create new widget” button. Then you need to fill out the form. The name is mandatory and you can also write the summary and the description for the widget.

## Generating The Widget Key

After successfully creating the widget you will be redirected to the widget page that you just created. To generate the key simply click the “Get a new key” button, you can always regenerate the key by clicking the button again.

If needed, you can also delete the widget, but keep in mind that this action is **not reversible**.
