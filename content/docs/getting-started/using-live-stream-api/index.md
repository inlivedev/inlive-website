# Using Live Stream API

We are currently re-designing our live stream API to make it more developer-friendly and easier to integrated with our other products. For now this API is only for internal use. We will announce it when it's ready for public use.

If you're interested to use this API, please [contact us](mailto:hello@inlive.app) and let us know your use case.
