# 5 Interactive Widgets You Can Build for Your Live Stream

Being interactive is a must for a live streaming experience right now. Instead of watching a pre-recorded video, viewers can take part in it and get a stronger connection with the hosts. The interactivity promises to bring many benefits and is suitable for many industries, such as e-commerce, sports, education, beauty & fitness, and many more!

We want to ensure the online interaction is as engaging as an in-person event. Using widgets can help leverage your interactive experience.

Here are five widgets you can develop to bring interactivity to your live stream.

## 1. Quiz

Test the knowledge of your audiences by enabling a quiz widget. Get creative with the quiz category and the way the host presents it. For example, teachers can use this widget to test the students how much they are listening during the class. Or sportscasters can use this widget to test their audience’s knowledge about a football club as an icebreaker on a match event.

## 2. Polling

Get immediate feedback from your audience right on your live stream. Allow viewers to take control of the action and control what they want to know. Live shopping hosts can use a poll to gather audience feedback on a product. Or musicians can use polling to control the next song they will play at an online concert.

## 3. Showcase

Exhibit products, merchandise, and even service to your audience. Launching a new collection of fashion items? Let the audience get familiar with your product by showcasing it during the launching event. Or production houses can play their movie trailer in a widget while the cast of the movie is having a conversation with the host during a live premiere.

## 4. Mini-Games

Have you ever been bored while waiting for a live stream break? Entertain your audience by enabling mini-games during the pause. You can bring the old arcade genre such as Tetris, Snake, or Space Invader-type games to your live stream. Reward your audience with shopping vouchers, coupons, or merchandise if they get a high score.

## 5. AR Filter

Brings the sophisticated Augmented Reality (AR) experience in a widget to your live stream. Let the audience try a shade of a brand new make-up product on themself, or yoga instructors can examine their student’s position during online class with the help of AR.
