# Paid Webinars? Now Easier than Ever with InLive Room

We've been on a mission to make InLive Room the absolute all-in-one platform for your webinar needs. We started with virtual rooms for seamless video calls (a must-have, of course\!), then added event pages to show the detailed information of your event and Easily manage registrations from your audience.

We even threw in post-event analytics to give you insights of your audience and your event’s success, with a guest book to see who attended and attendance tracking to know who stayed and who left early.

But we didn't stop there. We're committed to continuous improvement, and today we're thrilled to introduce a significant feature update that brings us closer to making InLive Room your all-in-one webinar platform.
