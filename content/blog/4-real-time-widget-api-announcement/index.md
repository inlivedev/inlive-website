# Introducing inLive Real-Time Widget API: Interaction beyond likes and comments

Today‚Äôs online interactions in live streams are often limited to likes and comments, opposite to what we can do in real-life events. Events like classes, exhibitions, sports matches, concerts, and many more can have multiple ways of interactions that can‚Äôt be accommodated when it‚Äôs held online by current live streaming platforms.

As we want to ensure that online interaction is as engaging as real-life events, we also wanted the development of interactive features on live streams to be simple and easy for all. Thus, we‚Äôre excited to introduce you to the **Real-Time Widget API** (Beta).
